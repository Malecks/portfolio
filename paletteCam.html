            <h3>Project background</h3>
            <p>In January of 2016 I started a bootcamp for iOS development at Lighthouse Labs in Toronto. The 8 week program taught Objective-C, Swift, and the ins-and-outs of iOS development. As a final project we were tasked with creating a functional app to demo, which is when I came up for the idea of Palette Cam.</p>
            
            <p>I wanted to build a tool for designers.</p>

            <h3>Project goals</h3>
            <p>Project Goals
            There were a number of goals I had for Palette Cam when I first started building that helped guide the development and product decisions throughout the process.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>The app should be about utility</b>
                    <p>Similar to a flashlight, calculator, or ruler app - I wanted Palette Cam to focus on a single promise and deliver it seamlessly without feature bloat.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Focus on design and ease of use</b>
                    <p>I wanted to lean on my experience as a designer to help Palette Cam stand out from other colour apps and provide a bug-free, interaction-rich, joyful experience.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Be ready for the App Store</b>
                    <p>This goal was maybe the most ambitious as it wasn’t a requirement for the Lighthouse Labs demo, but as a personal goal I had wanted to come out of my time in the bootcamp with an app that I could show friends and employers, ready to be downloaded to their own devices.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technology used</h3>
            <p>For version 1.0 I relied solely on technology provided by Apple, and a single API from Flikr for the photo feed. Palettes were stored quickly in User Preferences, and I used standard UICollectionViews and other UIKit elements throughout to keep things lightweight and straightforward.</p>
            <p>However as I continued to work on Palette Cam in my spare time, it became a testing ground for new libraries and technologies I was exploring as a developer.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>IGListKit</b>
                    <p>Provided easy to implement collection views, and auto-diffing with animations. I liked using this so much I ended up contributing a few lines to the open source project as well.</p>
                </li> 
                <li>
                    <b>Realm</b>
                    <p>A replacement for the quick and dirty solution of storing palettes in User Preferences. Realm provided an easy and free solution to real-time data storage.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Unsplash</b>
                    <p>The inspiration page uses an infinitely scrolling feed of photos from the Unsplash API to ensure users can start with the best quality photos.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>In-App Reviews</b>
                    <p>The use of in-app reviews contributed to a massive influx of positive user feedback</p>
                </li>

            <h3>Impact and Usage</h3>
            <p>
                Ever since launching Palette Cam I have been absolutely floored by the response and I’ve been especially amazed by all the ways people are using the app; from graphic design, to interior design, and even as a colour reference while painting. Palette cam has had great organic growth, and it has really encouraged me to keep working on and updating the project. Here are a few highlights:
